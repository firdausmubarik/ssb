<h2>About</h2>
<p>ScrapScrap and Beyond is a new interpretation of scraps through wearable arts. It is about exploring the art of scrap making beyond the traditional scrapbooking approach that we have enjoyed doing for years. Our handmade products are a result of finding new ways to collaborate with collages and bringing novelty to the scrap materials.</p><p>

In scrap making, bits and pieces of materials that are often left aside - if not forgotten at all – become the fundamental components. Scraps provide the singularities that create peculiar characters. They are the silent audiences but rich storytellers. They capture memories while standing aside, but burst with memories when taking the stage.</p><p>

For those who cherish novelties in repurposed functions and look, ScrapScrap and Beyond compose a new narrative through the art of collaging. Our handmade bags, pouches and boxes are made limitedly using scrap fabrics, creating a unique look in every piece. We take shabby chic style and bound it with dreamy color palette of white, ivories, and pastels. These elements then converse with words of wisdom you once heard, it feels like looking back through old photographs.</p><p>

ScrapScrap and Beyond’s design is about keeping memories alive and capturing new journey that are close to the souls. Stories are remnants of memories, and we hope to continue them one scrap at a time.</p><p>

 “ScrapScrap and Beyond is a collection filled with various of soft pale colored designs mixed with a diverse selection of patterns. Flower, stripes and polka dots are vibrant when applied to wearable objects. It creates memories and keeps identities. We collage our materials into handmade bag, pouches and household appliances to bring the beauty and peculiarity of one’s inner being.“</p><p>

<h2>Our Story</h2>

<p>From a very young age I had always been excited with the idea of being an artist whose passion in life is to create art. I composed piano pieces, wrote poems, read words that shaped the person I am today, and I scrapbooked.</p><p>

Small things that created memories are my favorites, and I learnt to capture them through scrapbooking. In it, tears, laughter, and struggle were collaged to recreate a new experience of the story. However, there is scrapbooking is beyond merely creating memories. It is an art of collaging scraps and recreating novelty through the remnants of memories - a concept that became embodied through ScrapScrap and Beyond.</p><p>

ScrapScrap and Beyond came after seven years of contemplation, of learning home business, of encountering the impossible. While visiting my parent’s house, I came across a pile of ribbons, polka dot textiles, and pale colored fabrics with flower prints. This view recollected my days of scrapbooking, and the next thing I knew I was sewing these fabrics and created my first collage series: a quaint collection of bags that individually distinct. It was the beginning of a new chapter in life and I am excited to share it with everyone who sees life – with its ups and downs – as exhilarating and gratifying.</p><p>

ScrapScrap and Beyond is specifically excited to pursue this art while sharing our values, benefits, and opportunities, specifically to women. This will offer its challenges; and we are fine with that. Indeed, it was for this reason that ScrapScrap and Beyond seeks energy to share our team’s creation and designs to the dreamers and memory-keepers out there. </p><p>

May our live remain filled with inspiration.</p>


<h2>Our Purpose</h2>

We wish to share, inspire, and encourage women to find their true strength and dreams. </p><p>
